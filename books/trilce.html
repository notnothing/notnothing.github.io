      <span>EXCERPT</span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>This is not a book about translation</p>
      <p>or a book.</p>
      <p>I don’t speak the Spanish it wants.</p>
      <p>My beloved with her blonde hair pulled up</p>
      <p>in a bun with pearl earrings, staring at the shops</p>
      <p>slurping pizza on eighth avenue with her fat dad,</p>
      <p>I dedicate this whole maneuver to your stainless steel</p>
      <p>water, your future by the coast</p>
      <p>of all Carolinas: an unmovable, actual past</p>
      <p>constructed wholly unlike you,</p>
      <p>the history of flavored ice, the titanic symbol</p>
      <p>system of your hoop earrings, your high, frightening</p>
      <p>denim, your black hair— I dedicate this to the models.</p>
      <p>New York in the age of Vallejo. The Mid-Atlantic in my age</p>
      <p>of Vallejo, a crisp age, a set of years extending back beyond</p>
      <p>a first encounter: a birth of the world as the primitives in Florence</p>
      <p>experience sky on gold leaf. I am a dedicated,</p>
      <p>impassioned cause, if I am honest and true</p>
      <p>in how I dream, think, and imagine the future for the others</p>
      <p>I plan to live my life. O tussled matte of blonded curl above</p>
      <p>the moka pot screaming, Parisian, maybe, in Madrid, but never</p>
      <p>actually Spanish; beauty of Buenos Aires, the city New</p>
      <p>York still thinks it is. O rigid element to right my life.</p>
      <p>O guiltless coke. O blood war beneath the keys as they swing</p>
      <p>below the crotch, as the air smells of gasoline, as the black Cadillac</p>
      <p>pulls through north Brooklyn. Babies up in the skylight, backless blouse</p>
      <p>concealing a murder. O way of speaking that sets me</p>
      <p>Beauty in the vast expanse without substitute</p>
      <p>won’t maintain the love, the work.</p>
      <p>This book speaks Spanish.</p>
      <p>To love the other as you would their tongue—</p>
      <p>to examine the tongue, or lead the examined tongue,</p>
      <p>into a unified sensory field, a principle by which to appreciate, or examine, the arches,</p>
      <p>I accept a series of moves.</p>
      <p>At night the states shift:</p>
      <p>the provinces, the districts, regional capitols, regal</p>
      <p>deaths in the Philippines sleep, the high ship</p>
      <p>on the break of the wave, in the colors of Napoli,</p>
      <p>the lives of the artists that render the left hip, the pudge,</p>
      <p>of those to be seen— I dedicate these bodies</p>
      <p>to the system of symbols they need. New Spain</p>
      <p>sleeps in soft waves. New Spain’s got its skull split</p>
      <p>beneath the G: the Union put its gut upon the railings</p>
      <p>of the mid-century boardwalks, along Delaware. Because</p>
      <p>of the Vallejo, I am unhappy, determined in the ways I need,</p>
      <p>free to be unhappy, realistic,</p>
      <p>in the unsafe past, the blocks that have been blocks,</p>
      <p>the brick of my Mary-Anne, the detritic coffee</p>
      <p>and the beef rib, the sesame, the bun soaked</p>
      <p>and the tallow on the counter. I am in it— the dream of my cities.</p>
      <p>Or the dream of my love. Or the way in which she dreams.</p>
      <p>Or you, who floats along the edge of all words, who</p>
      <p>means so much, all things said, are said to you.</p>
      <p>All things are said otherwise</p>
