    <span>EXCERPT</span>
    <br /><br />
    <p>When one lives with others, a life seems shared; every moment is imbued with meaning. When one is alone, the passing days seem instead to hurtle toward death. We must inscribe in another that time without measure which constitutes our lives.</p>
    <p>*</p>
    <p>Baring writes that October is the most beautiful of months — <i>le voici</i>; it has arrived. The first touch of autumn shows itself in the blanching leaves of riverside poplars, the changing colors passionate and burning in their final throes of life.</p>
    <p>*</p>
    <p>To surmount, to descend to the center of one’s very self. The astonishment of discovering there a previously unknown strength, fraternal to despair. </p>
    <p>*</p>
    <p>What is learned will too be lost; what one prays will never come to pass will, upon arrival, enrich and ameliorate. All the more reason to cultivate doubt, to give oneself over to the unexpected.</p>
    <p>*</p>
    <p>A family is joined by a new member, and each must add new nuance to belief, must reconfigure existing values to accommodate…</p>
    <p>*</p>
    <p>Youth is chaotic, too many conflicting forces giving battle and arousing, if needed, a sense of tragic and senseless heroism. It is a time at once slow-burning and explosive. Freedom comes only later, when one has decanted, has become more oneself over the years, nearer to essence.</p>
    <p>*</p>
    <p>Never despair at loss; the disappeared itself concealed, and upon disappearance unveils, something new and beautiful, inaccessible before.</p>
    <p>*</p>
    <p>The tolling of the bells sounds softened as if muted by felt. One hardly notices the barges in the mist as they pass; the landscape itself appears illusory, dissociated, so that one feels a little less than alive.</p>
    <p>*</p>
    <p>The white cat is my keeper and witness, following my every move. She shares fifteen years worth of memories with me, succeeding a ghostly cat before her now daily missed. She too would like to be loved. Like all scorned creatures, her loyalty is absolute.</p>
    <p>*</p>
    <p>So many echoes still resounding throughout this house… and an impetuous heart, equally prone to tears and joy at the drop of a hat. And after too long living unloved… this heart becomes embarrassed, begins to feel shame at the mere fact of its existence.</p>
