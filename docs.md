### Book Formatting
## New Book Procedure
Build a custom template from the Not Nothing page format, complete with lorem ipsum text, margins, footnote settings, etc.

## Document Setting Defaults
# Prose
4x6” (24x36 picas), with 0.5” vertical, .6875” inside, and .375” outside margins. Text is 9pt Baskerville with Auto spacing (typically 10.8). Indentations typically between 0.125 and 0.25” for both block quotes and first lines.
Footnotes typically have 0.0625” minimum spacing between the main text body and footnote. Spacing between footnotes is variable but minimal. Ruling is always off for both first column and continued columns.
# Poetry
6x6”.

## Colophon & Title Page

### Design

## Typefaces
There is a [Fonts folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1in024Ucwl9frYGDBQoEgnOUtiLSlcrLO) in the OOO GDrive where all .ttc/.ott/.ttf files should be uploaded. This’ll let us sync up on typefaces and start to establish a house library of “brand” fonts.
## Printing
We print cream paper. 
## Cover
The cover must be 4.5” vertically and a minimum of 6.5” horizontally. However, the spine will add between ¼” and 2” to the necessary cover width. 

### Website
Website cover images are 145px W x 218px H at the moment. Down the line, we may transition to a poetry/prose division, in which case we could represent the poetry books at proper aspect ratio (6x6”).
